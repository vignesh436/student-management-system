# student-management-system
1. Requirements:
 
Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.

A database (such as SQLite, MySQL, or even using flat files for simplicity).

An IDE (such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA) or simple text editors (VS Code, Notepad++).

2. System Design:
   
a. Classes:
Student: To represent student attributes.

StudentDatabase: To perform operations like adding, deleting, and viewing records.

StudentDatabaseApp: To run the main program and interact with the user.

3. Features of the System:
   
Add Student: Allows the user to enter a student's roll number, name, course, and marks.

Remove Student: Allows the user to delete a student's record based on the roll number.

View All Students: Displays all the students currently in the database.

Search Student: Allows the user to search for a student by roll number.

4. Future Improvements:
   
Implement a persistent database (e.g., SQLite or MySQL) instead of using in-memory storage.

Add the ability to update student records

Implement user authentication (e.g., login functionality).

Add input validation for better error handling.

5. Running the Project:

Compile the Java files:

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where the files are saved.

Run: javac Student.java StudentDatabase.java StudentDatabaseApp.java.

Run the Program:

After compilation, run the program by typing: java StudentDatabaseApp.
Follow the prompts to interact with the database.

6. Optional Enhancements:
 
Use GUI (Graphical User Interface) for easier interaction, using JavaFX or Swing.

Add file handling (e.g., saving and loading student data from a file).
